=head1 NAME

MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained - L<DateTime> related constraints and coercions for Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Export Example:

	use MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained qw(TimeZone);
	has time_zone => (
			isa  => TimeZone
			, is => "rw"
			, coerce => 1
	);
	Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );
	Class->new( time_zone => "CEST" );

Namespaced Example:

	use MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained;
	has time_zone => (
		isa  => 'DateTime::TimeZone'
		, is => "rw"
		, coerce => 1
	);
	Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );

=head1 CONSTRAINTS

=over 4

=item L<DateTime>

A class type for L<DateTime>.

=over 4

=item from C<Num>

Uses L<DateTime/from_epoch>. Floating values will be used for subsecond percision, see L<DateTime> for details.

=item from C<HashRef>

Calls L<DateTime/new> with the hash entries as arguments.

=back

=item L<Duration>

A class type for L<DateTime::Duration>

=over 4

=item from C<Num>

Uses L<DateTime::Duration/new> and passes the number as the C<seconds> argument.

Note that due to leap seconds, DST changes etc this may not do what you expect.  For instance passing in C<86400> is not always equivalent to one day, although there are that many seconds in a day. See L<DateTime/"How Date Math is Done"> for more details.

=item from C<HashRef>

Calls L<DateTime::Duration/new> with the hash entries as arguments.

=back

=item L<DateTime::Locale>

A class type for L<DateTime::Locale::root> with the name L<DateTime::Locale>.

=over 4

=item from C<Str>

The string is treated as a language tag (e.g. C<en> or C<he_IL>) and given to L<DateTime::Locale/load>.

=item from L<Locale::Maktext>

The C<Locale::Maketext/language_tag> attribute will be used with L<DateTime::Locale/load>.

=back

=item L<DateTime::TimeZone>

A class type for L<DateTime::TimeZone>, this now as of 0.05 coerces from non-globally ambigious Olson abbreviations, using L<Olson::Abbreviations>. This won't work for abbreviations like "EST" which are only unambigious if you know the locale. It will coerce from abbreviations like "CEST" though.

=over 4

=item from C<Str>

Treated as a time zone name or offset. See L<DateTime::TimeZone/USAGE> for more details on the allowed values.

Delegates to L<DateTime::TimeZone/new> with the string as the C<name> argument.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module packages several L<Moose::Util::TypeConstraints> with coercions, designed to work with the L<DateTime> suite of objects.

This module started as a fork of L<MooseX::Types::DateTime>. This history and explaination is as follows:
In Janurary 2009, I began a project to bring DateTime::Format::* stuff up to date with Moose. I created a framework that would greatly eliminate redundant code named L<DateTimeX::Format>. This project's adoption was slowed by then (and still currently) bundeled B<package> MooseX::Types::DateTime. MooseX::Types::DateTime was a badly packaged extention of two modules the self-titled MooseX::Types::DateTime, and another random module MooseX::Types::DateTimeX. In Februrary of the same year, I repackaged the module L<MooseX::Types::DateTimeX> with the authors blessing into a new package, for the purpose of removing its dependenices, namely L<Date::Manip>, from MooseX::Types::DateTime.

Unfortunately, this just added confusion. Now, as of the time of writing L<MooseX::Types::DateTimeX> is available as a package, and it is available as a module which will be installed by L<MooseX::Types::DateTime>. The benefit of removing the dependency on L<MooseX::Types::DateTime> was never realized and the patch that updates the dependencies, and the build system remains in rt still as of writing.

This module is just the L<MooseX::Types::DateTime> without the requirement on L<DateTimeX::Easy> (which requires L<DateTime::Manip>). As of 0.05 this module supports globally unique Olson abbreviations, and dies when they are not globally unique.
